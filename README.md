# WWE React

<!-- TODO: What do you think about React so far? What make sense? What connections are there to the JS fundamentals that you have learned prior to this? Reflect and personalize this! -->

## Thoughts on React ðŸ¤”

I think that react could be _fun_ to play around with. It it a little confusing, but it does get much easier after further explanation.

I **feel** as though once a person gets the hang of react it makes everything else much easier to deal with.
It's obvious that **React** is necessary to work cooperatively alongside the js fundamentals because it seems as if they almost lean on one another.

> I would be interested to learn more about React and would definitely like to play around with it more in the future.ðŸ”®
